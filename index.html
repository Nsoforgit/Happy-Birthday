<!-- Happy birthday to the only girlfriend my mom has ever truly liked. That's a feat worth celebrating today and every day!
Tell your mom I say thanks for birthing you!!!
I donâ€™t know how I tricked you into loving me, but Iâ€™m sure glad I did. Happy birthday!
What was your birthday wish last year? Me?!
Wait...what was that one Jeremih song again? ðŸ˜‰
Gorgeous, hilarious, hotter by the yearâ€¦is exactly what I am! Which is why you donâ€™t need any more gifts. Love ya!
Happy birthday to the girl thatâ€™s basically a human space heater. You can put your burning-hot feet on me anytime.
Happy birthday! Letâ€™s get drunk and stuff our faces with cake.
I would give you the world if I could, baby. But alas, you've seen my paycheck.
Happy birthday, baby! You donâ€™t look your age...or act like it either. ðŸ˜‰
Youâ€™re older and wiser, but hopefully not so wise that you break up with my dumb ass.
I'd say we're raising a glass to you tonight...but we're raising the whole damn bottle!
Please still love me despite how off-key I will be singing "Happy Birthday" tonight. I promise I'll make it worth it.
Older? Def. Wiser? Weeeeelll, that might be up for interpretation...
Girl, drop that skincare routine! You're getting more gorgeous by the year!
You came into this world naked and screaming, and I hope you party just as hard tonight.
I have the hottest girlfriend in town, and she has an even hotter partner. Happy birthday!
Happy birthday to the only person I could tolerate 24/7 with. I love you!
Happy birthday to the person that says sheâ€™s not hungry and then steals all my food. The fries are yours today, babe!
I was going to wish you the best birthday ever, but since youâ€™re spending it with me, I know it will be. -->



<!-- I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up
Oh, need a love, now
My heart is thinking of
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up -->
